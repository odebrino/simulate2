## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**SIMULATE 2** is a continuation of the SIMULATE 1 project, aiming to improve the realism of **surgical coniotomy simulation** for military medical training.  
It combines **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **3D modeling**, and **AI-based step recognition** to guide and evaluate each stage of the procedure.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Develop an **AR projection** of a human larynx using Unity + AR tools.  
- Enable **real-time step recognition** (repÃ©rage â†’ incision â†’ insertion â†’ verification).  
- Provide a **tactile and visual training** tool for military medical trainees.  
- Improve realism compared to low-fidelity models from SIMULATE 1.
